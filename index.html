        Black fish Blue fish Old fish New fish.
        This one has a little star. This one has a little car. Say! What a lot
        Of fish there are.
        Yes. Some are red. And some are blue. Some are old. And some are new.

        And some are very, very bad.
        Why are they Sad and glad bad? I do not know.

        Are everywhere.
